//! Beta samplers: one exact reference and several cheap approximations.
//!
//! Thompson Sampling needs a draw from each arm's `Beta(alpha, beta)`
//! posterior. Drawing exactly costs two Gamma variates, which is not free, so
//! production routers frequently substitute something cheaper — usually the
//! posterior mean plus noise. Those substitutions are the object of study in
//! this crate, so they are implemented faithfully in [`legacy`] rather than
//! quietly fixed, and the harness in `thompson-sim` measures what they cost.
//!
//! Use [`Exact`] unless you are running an experiment.
